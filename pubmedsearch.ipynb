dislocation and subluxation occurs frequently in athletes with peaks in the second and sixth decades. The majority (98%) of traumatic dislocations are in the anterior direction. The most frequent complication of shoulder dislocation is recurrence, a complication that occurs much more frequently in the adolescent population. The static (predominantly capsuloligamentous and labral) and dynamic (neuromuscular) restraints to shoulder instability are now well defined. Rehabilitation aims to enhance the dynamic muscular and proprioceptive restraints to shoulder instability. This paper reviews the nonoperative treatment and the postoperative management of patients with various classifications of shoulder instability.\nJ Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2002 32 10\n['Hayes K', 'Callanan M', 'Walton J', 'Paxinos A', 'Murrell GA']\nHayes K, et al.

Consisting of three interrelated dimensions, chronic illness, functional status, and self-rated health, this model was empirically evaluated by using national data on the aged gathered in the United States and Japan. The three-dimensional specification was found to apply equally well to U.S. and Japanese elderly. In addition to examining the internal structure of this three-dimensional model, the study assessed the model's relationships with a set of selected exogenous variables including age, sex, marital status, and education. The relationships between the selected exogenous variables and physical health dimensions are largely similar in both countries. However, clear differences appeared in at least three instances.\nMed Care 1991 29 12\n['Liang J', 'Bennett J', 'Whitelaw N', 'Maeda D']\nLiang J, et al.

Using confirmatory factor analysis on noninstitutionalized elderly from Cleveland (N = 1834) and Virginia (N = 2146), the 21 OARS mental health items were fit to a 15-item model. In addition to the second-order construct of mental health, there were four first-order dimensions: life satisfaction, psychosomatic symptomatology, alienation, and cognitive deficit. Analyses were further replicated by splitting both samples in half. The model fit well and compared favorably to other alternative specifications. In addition to this analysis of internal structure, the model was also examined in relation to several exogenous factors including age, sex, race, education, and physical health. While the model again fit well, a model with cognitive deficit separate from the other factors seemed more reasonable.\nJ Gerontol 1989 44 5\n['Liang J', 'Levin JS', 'Krause NM']\nLiang J, et al.

As such, the focus is not merely on the identification of the direct effects of a variety of factors on perceived health status, but on how the constructs of disease, functional limitation, and self-rated health interrelate. In so doing, we expose the inherent problems of several complex and contaminated items routinely included in applications of established functional health status measures. The source of these problems lies in the lack of specificity or conceptual clarity for the individual items in these established measures. Potential biases are discussed, and several methods and strategies for addressing these problems are explored. Alternative scales are constructed and their psychometric properties are presented. Researchers who rely on public use data bases containing these scales should be aware of the potential biases and either modify the scales or use other appropriate methodologies to control for the measurement contamination.\nJ Health Soc Behav 1993 34 2\n['Johnson RJ', 'Wolinsky FD']\nJohnson RJ and Wolinsky FD.

A decade of experience in geriatric assessment.\nThe Older Americans Resources and Services (OARS) methodology was designed to assess functional capacity in five dimensions (social resources, economic resources, mental health, physical health, and activities of daily living) and to measure use of and need for 24 types of generic services. The OARS questionnaire now has been used in more than 150 research and practice settings. Recent refinements in the OARS methodology include new information about validity and reliability, computerized summary ratings for the five dimensions of functional status, and eleven scales that measure specific aspects of functioning within the five dimensions. This paper describes the conceptual foundation, appropriate uses, psychometric properties, and recent refinements in the OARS methodology. Empirical data from a geriatric clinic population are used for purposes of illustration. The paper presents an assessment of the strengths and limitations of the OARS methodology based on more than a decade of experience. Particular attention is paid to the degree to which the measures of functional status can be related to health service use measures to inform geriatric research and practice.\nJ Am Geriatr Soc 1985 33 9\n['George LK', 'Fillenbaum GG']\nGeorge LK and Fillenbaum GG.
